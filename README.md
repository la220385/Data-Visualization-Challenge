# Pymaceuticals Study: Capomulin Treatment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is part of an analysis on the effectiveness of various drug regimens, particularly **Capomulin**, in reducing tumor volume in mice. The data contains information on **tumor volume**, **mouse weight**, and **treatment regimens**. Key goals include determining the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume, calculating the **correlation coefficient**, and performing a **linear regression analysis** to visualize the relationship.

## Conclusion
The analysis showed a **strong positive correlation** between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin, with an **R-squared value** of **0.71**, indicating that approximately **71% of the variability in tumor volume** can be explained by mouse weight.
